This website will both introduce me and be a testing ground where I can add or remove any feature I can think of. I am currently adding a todo list to this site, whose homepage is `https://mrfrkn.com`, but this todo list will be personal `https://mrfrkn.com/todologin.html`. So each person will have their own todo list. I am sharing the codes of the project openly because the passwords of people who register and log in will be hashed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
We are currently having a problem registering via IOS. You can register if you log in from any device other than iOS. But there is no problem logging in.
